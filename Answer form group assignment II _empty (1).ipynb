    "# Group assignment part II: implementing the system \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this template to build the script to run the glycolitic oscillation reaction system.\n",
    "Parts of the code are already filled in to make implementation easier (for example, you do not need to write the integration routine, you can use the built-in solve_IVP approach of scipy). Additionally, please have a look at the workflow slide that is added to the group project folder to help you in setting up the code properly (essentially, the workflow sums up the output of part I of the assignment). \n",
    "\n",
    "The system is based on Henson et al. (2002) and Lapin et al 2004: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ie030786k#\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is divided in three parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: all cells are equal** (one cell population) [75 points]\n",
    "- Plot the NADH oscillations in the system for the first 10 minutes.\n",
    "- Compare with the data plotted in Lapin (2004) in figure 5, after 55 minutes: do you observe similar oscillations? (you can also use slide 9 of lecture 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: assume all cells are equal, but use 50 populations** [15 points]\n",
    "- Plot the NADH oscillations for all cell populations for the first 10 minutes.\n",
    "- Since all cells are equal, the results should match the result of part 1, is that true?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3: Use 50 populations, apply 5% variation on initial intra-cellular values** [10 points]\n",
    "- Plot the NADH oscillations for all cell populations for the first 10 minutes, and for 90-100 minutes.\n",
    "- Do you observe heterogeneity intially, and synchronization in the population later on? \n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, write output data every $0.01$ minute. \n",
    "\n",
    "*TIPS*:\n",
    "- If you set up the functions in part 1 right, part 2 and 3 are not a lot of additional work. The main difference between part 1 and part 2/3 is that you need to 'loop over Nc cell populations'. But, if you already build the loop in part 1, you can use the same functions in all parts (after all, part 1 is just using the loop for Nc = 1). \n",
    "- But: the majority of the points can be acquired in the first part of the assignment. If you are uncertain whether you can do all three parts in the provided time, you can choose to not build in the loop and focus on part 1 only - and still get 75/100 points. \n",
    "- If you choose to first do part I without building in a loop, and then decide to do part II and III anyway, we recommend to make new functions for part II/III rather than adjusting the functions of part I. Otherwise, the modifications may result in part I not working anymore either - and that would be a waste of effort.  \n",
    "- Mind the units and signs! These (and typos) are the easiest to make a mistake in. All the expected outcomes are in the slides that were provided in lecture 7, so you can always look at them to see if your code works correctly. \n",
    "- For the assignments, you only need to plot NADH. But, in the slides several plots for extra- and intra-cellular PYR are shown. It may be good to plot these as well so you can verify your answer (you can leave them in the file you hand in, if you want, but that is your choice).\n",
